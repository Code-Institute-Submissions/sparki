Katerina Elsasser’s Spraki Website

This project is for the company ‘Sparki’ which is a electrician company based 
in the south of England. The aim of the website is to promote this company to 
customers in the Berkshire/Surrey areas. The website must include what the 
electrician company can do as well as photos showing what the company can do 
(include industrial, commercial and domestic work).

UX
Sparki are looking for a simple designed website that would help promote 
them to new customers and current customers that are in the area of 
Berkshire/Surrey. They want to promote to customers wanting domestic work, 
or businesses who wanted commercial and industrial work. They want to include 
photos of work that they have already done to show what they can do. 
After thinking about what they want, I started to do some research with 
companies that are in the area that would be Sparki’s competition. As well 
as this, I have looked at a popular website that specialises in promoting 
tradesmen such as Electricians. When looking at each website, made some pros 
and cons. After looking at all the pros and cons, I went back to Sparki to see 
what they like and don’t like as well as what the customer would want to see.

While researching competitors’ websites, I started to think what needed to be 
included. The first thing I thought about was what navigation pages will be 
needed. Having four pages (home, service, gallery and contact). The home page 
would have the overall information from all four pages. The service page would 
include all the services that Sparki do. The gallery would include all the 
photos that they have taken of the work they have done previously. The contact 
page would be how the customer can contact the company. 

While doing my research, I saw that a lot of companies clutter up their 
navigation which would be too messy. Some of the websites include reviews from 
previous customers. From a customer’s point of view, you would want to see what
other customers opinions are about this company.

The layout of the website needs to simple and nothing complicated which is 
what the company wants. Sparki were going to supply the website with images 
that they wanted to be on. 

*I started off by creating the nativation/header and the footer of the website.
I wanted to put the logo above the natigation bar.
