# Katerina Elsasser’s Spraki Website
-----
This project is for the company ‘Sparki’ which is a electrician company based 
in the south of England. The aim of the website is to promote this company to 
customers in the Berkshire/Surrey areas and to get those customers to contact 
Sparki. The website must include what the electrician company can do as well as 
photos showing what the company can do (including commercial and domestic work).

Below has all the research and how I created, tested and improved a website for 
this company. To see the final outcome of the website I made for Sparki, [click here](https://sparki-website-katerinaelsasser21.c9users.io/index.html).

## UX

#### Surface
* Colours - In this industry, they use the term "Earth". I wanted to use that and
include colours that were earth related. Which means different greens and 
browns. I found a picture of Eucalyptus and use it as my colour [reference](https://assets.bhg.com/bhg/styles/nfp_1080_portrait/public/images/2015/9/28/Nov-color-opener-NEW.jpg?48XOLehbxwDKpF5J9ZgjBy5aCTxQ2pCj).
I use colours from this picture to use throughout the website.
* Typology - The company wanted to use simple and basic text which was easy to 
read. I went to Google Fonts, where I found the font "Comfortaa". Which was 
easy to read. 
* Layout - The layout has to be simple, not too busy. Easy to follow and to find
pages. I drew up [mock ups](https://sparki-website-katerinaelsasser21.c9users.io/mock-up.html) and ideas that I thought was easy to understand. I 
also took into acount what parts of the websites that i liked and thought 
worked well.
* Images - The images that I was going to use were images that are of jobs that
the company has done. As well as this, I am using images that are of the members
of the team working on jobs.

#### Strategy
The company want customers to find their contact information and also information
of the services. Taking this to mind, I want there to be lots of links to the 
contact page. This website is aimed at customers and I also
want to aim at businesses that would want to use the company's commercial services.
#### Structure
The layout throughout the website must be informational and have an simple 
layout. All the information that is on the website is give to myself from the 
company. Putting myself in the customers' and the business' point of view, I 
would want to see all the inforamtion that I need layed out clearly and where I 
can find it easily. The home page will have quick highlights of the website for 
customers needing a last minute electrician. There must be links to the website
for businesses to take their time to do their research about the company.
The content I use throughout the website must be appropriate for customers and 
businesses. As a customer wanting an electrician, I would view their website 
via a mobile or small device. Which means the smaller view ports should be easy
to view. For businesses, I would view the company's website via a computer.
#### Skeleton
The main things about the website that will form the backbone of it are the
navigation which will be featured on the header and the footer on each html page.
By doing this, it will make the whole webpage look uniform. The only thing that 
will differ each page will be the section.
#### Scope
The research was a massive key to this website as there are is a lot of competion
in the area and I want to see what other companies are doing and what they are
missing from their website. The research I do will help shape the website I 
create for Sparki.
I looked at four electrician companies that would be Sparki's competitors and 
put together pros and cons to each website I looked at.[Click here](https://sparki-website-katerinaelsasser21.c9users.io/research.html)
to see the research I did and what conclusion I have afterwards.

Sparki are looking for a simple designed website that would help promote 
them to new customers and current customers that are in the area of 
Berkshire/Surrey. They want to include photos of work that they have already 
done to show what they can do. 
After thinking about what they want, I started to do some research with 
companies that are in the area that would be Sparki’s competition. As well 
as this, I have looked at a popular website that specialises in promoting 
tradesmen such as Electricians. When looking at each website, made some pros 
and cons. After looking at all the pros and cons, I went back to Sparki to see 
what they like and don’t like as well as what the customer would want to see.

While researching competitors’ websites, I started to think what needed to be 
included. The first thing I thought about was what navigation pages will be 
needed. Having four pages (home, service, gallery and contact). The home page 
would have the overall information from all four pages. The service page would 
include all the services that Sparki do. The gallery would include all the 
photos that they have taken of the work they have done previously. The contact 
page would be how the customer can contact the company. 

While doing my research, I saw that a lot of companies clutter up their 
navigation which would be too messy. Some of the websites include reviews from 
previous customers. From a customer’s point of view, you would want to see what
other customers opinions are about this company.

The layout of the website needs to simple and nothing complicated which is 
what the company wants. Sparki were going to supply the website with images 
that they wanted to be on. 

*I started off by creating the nativation/header and the footer of the website.
I wanted to put the logo above the natigation bar.


## Features

#### Existing Features
* Header - I have created a navigation; including home, service, gallery and 
contact that all link to the page with the same name. In between the navigation
bar, I have added the logo above the navigation.
* Footer - I have added text explaining about the company, a link to the contact 
page and four buttons linking to the home, service, gallery and the contact page.
* Home page - I have added buttons with a hyperlink that take the customers to 
specific page. For example: the section for the service page has a hyperlink 
to the page service.html. I have also displayed images the company has supplied
me with of members of their team working.
I have also linked the headings for each of the sections to each of the pages. 
* Service page - I have displayed the two services that the company does in a box
and underneath I have created bulletpoints of what they can do for those services.
This has been inspired by the bootstrap example, [Pricing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/examples/pricing/). 
I alternatied the code by only exanding two boxes to fill the whole page so I can
put the information in side of the box. I removed the pricing element as all I 
wanted was to contain the information of the services. I adjusted the colour of 
the button to suit the style of Sparki's website.
Underneath the services I have displayed two images of the work the company has
done.
* Gallery page - I have added several images on to this page to display them for
customers to see. I have made them into thumbnails, as this is easier to view
them all. All of the images that have been used throughout the website has been 
used in the gallery. The layout of the images have been inspired and developed 
from bootstraps example, [Album](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/examples/album/).
At the top of the page I have create a small snippet of 
text just saying that if they see anything in the gallery that they would like 
done then to click the button. The button takes the customer to the contact page.
*Contact page - I have put a form for customers to fill out for any queries or 
requested for the company to ask them. This feature has been developed from 
Bootstraps example, [Checkout](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/examples/checkout/).
I have also added other contact information for customers to contact Sparki and 
I have added links to Sparki's social media pages.
* Mobile View - The mobile view of all the pages I wanted it to be very simple. I
have the navigation bar going downward and underneath are the page information.

#### Features Left to Implement
In the future as Sparki gets found more by customers and their services get use,
the company will hopefully get review from those customers. When they are a
few reviews, they will want to display the reviews on their website. I would put
those reviews on the home page as future customers will the home page covered in
good reviews which will help with advertisement for Sparki. 
Also when Sparki starts posting more on their social media platforms, they will
want that placed on their website on the home page as well.

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap V4.3


## Testing
*Testing out different views, updating the grid system so it works for all viewports.

## Development
*Footer - I have updated the footer because I want to link only the pages and 
keep the layout simple. I have removed the information about the company (moving
that information to the home page) and the contact section (putting a link on 
each page that links to contact.html).
*Home page - I have updated the buttons on each of the sections. Instead of it
linking to the html of the same name. It is linked to the contact page, this is
because the company wants customers to get in contact with their team easily.
