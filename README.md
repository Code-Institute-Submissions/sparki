# Katerina Elsasser’s Spraki Website
-----
This project is for the company ‘Sparki’ which is a electrician company based 
in the south of England. The aim of the website is to promote this company to 
customers in the Berkshire/Surrey areas and to get those customers to contact 
Sparki. The website must include what the electrician company can do as well as 
photos showing what the company can do (including commercial and domestic work).

Below has all the research and how I created, tested and improved a website for 
this company. To see the final outcome of the website I made for Sparki, [click here](https://sparki-website-katerinaelsasser21.c9users.io/index.html).

## UX

#### Surface
When I started to think of the surface of the website, I started to think about
the layout, the colours, the typology and the imagery used throughout. The 
layout has to be simple, not too busy. Easy to follow and to find pages. I drew 
up [mock ups](https://sparki-website-katerinaelsasser21.c9users.io/mock-up.html) 
and ideas that I thought was easy to understand. I also took into acount what 
parts of the websites that i liked and thought worked well. The images that I 
was going to use were images that are of jobs that the company has done. As 
well as this, I am using images that are of the members of the team working on 
jobs. Lastly the typology and colours,the font I chose was readable and the 
colours I chose were simple as I didn't want these to take the focus away from 
what the website is intended for.
#### Strategy
The company want customers to find their contact information and also information
of the services. Taking this to mind, I want there to be lots of links to the 
contact page. This website is aimed at customers and I also
want to aim at businesses that would want to use the company's commercial services.
#### Structure
The layout throughout the website must be informational and have an simple 
layout. All the information that is on the website is give to myself from the 
company. Putting myself in the customers' and the business' point of view, I 
would want to see all the inforamtion that I need layed out clearly and where I 
can find it easily. The home page will have quick highlights of the website for 
customers needing a last minute electrician. There must be links to the website
for businesses to take their time to do their research about the company.
The content I use throughout the website must be appropriate for customers and 
businesses. As a customer wanting an electrician, I would view their website 
via a mobile or small device. Which means the smaller view ports should be easy
to view. For businesses, I would view the company's website via a computer.
#### Skeleton
The main things about the website that will form the backbone of it are the
navigation which will be featured on the header and the footer on each html page.
By doing this, it will make the whole webpage look uniform. The only thing that 
will differ each page will be the section.
#### Scope
Research was key for this website as I can see what other competitors have on the
website and also what they are missing from their website
I put together all my research on one page, [click here](https://sparki-website-katerinaelsasser21.c9users.io/research.html)

#### User Stories
* As a user, I want to see a page that has all the information to contact the company.
* As a user, I want to click on the navigation, and it will take me to the location
of that specific page.
* As a user, I want to see a clear header and footer layout so it is understandable.
* As a user, I want to click on a page to view all of the services that the company has.
* As a user, I want a page that displays all of the images.
* As a user, I want to click a button that will take me to a designated page.

## Features
Throughout the page, there is a navigation bar on the header and the footer that
takes you to the designated area. As well as this, I have put buttons on all the 
pages that will take the customer to the contact page so they will contact Sparki.

#### Existing Features
* Buttons - This allows the users to get to a page by clicking on it.
* Form - This allows the user to contact the company by filling the sections out
and pressing submit.
* Hover - This allows the user to see clearly which navigation title they might 
click on by hovering over one of the titles.
* Dropdown - This allows the user to view the navigation bar in the mobile view.
*Social Media Links - This allows the user to get the social media page by clicking
on the designated social media name.

#### Features Left to Implement
In the future as Sparki gets found more by customers and their services get use,
the company will hopefully get review from those customers. When they are a
few reviews, they will want to display the reviews on their website. I would put
those reviews on the home page as future customers will the home page covered in
good reviews which will help with advertisement for Sparki. 
Also when Sparki starts posting more on their social media platforms, they will
want that placed on their website on the home page as well.

## Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap


## Testing
* Contact form:
1. Go to the contact page
2. Type on a letter into the email section to see a error message.
3. Clicked on the submit button with empty cells to see an error message

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.



## Devoyment
*Footer - I have updated the footer because I want to link only the pages and 
keep the layout simple. I have removed the information about the company (moving
that information to the home page) and the contact section (putting a link on 
each page that links to contact.html).
*Home page - I have updated the buttons on each of the sections. Instead of it
linking to the html of the same name. It is linked to the contact page, this is
because the company wants customers to get in contact with their team easily.
