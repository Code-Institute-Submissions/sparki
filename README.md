# Katerina Elsasser’s Spraki Website
-----
This project is for the company ‘Sparki’ which is a electrician company based 
in the south of England. The aim of the website is to get those customers to contact 
Sparki as well as showing what services they do.

## UX

#### Surface
I started to think about the layout, the colours, the typology and the imagery 
used throughout. The layout has to be simple for customers to understand it 
and easy to find pages. I drew up different mockups and ideas that I thought was
easy to understand. I also took into account what 
parts of the mockups that i liked and worked them into the final outcome. The 
images that are used are what the company requested to be displayed. 
Below are the mockups that I drew.

Lastly the 
typology and colours, these have to be clear and readable.
#### Strategy
The main request from the company is that they want customers to find the contact
information easily and information of what services Sparki does. 
Taking this to mind, I want there to be lots of links that take the user to the
contact page.
#### Structure
The layout throughout the website must be informative and have an uniform structure. 
All the information that is on the website is give to myself from the 
company. The home page will have quick summaries of the other web pages with a 
button linked to the contact page to take the customers to that page. The content I use throughout the 
website must be appropriate for customers and 
businesses. As a customer wanting an electrician, I am more likley to look up the 
page via a small device like a phone. This means the smaller view ports are my 
priority to be readable.
#### Skeleton
The main things about the website that will form the backbone are the
navigation which will be featured on the header on each html page.
By doing this, it will make the whole webpage look uniform. The only thing that 
will differ each page will be the section.
#### Scope
Research was key for this website as there is competition in the area. I put 
together all my research on one page, [click here](https://sparki-website-katerinaelsasser21.c9users.io/research.html)

#### User Stories
* As a user, I want to see a page that has all the information to contact the company.
* As a user, I want to click on the navigation, and it will take me to the location
of that specific page.
* As a user, I want to see a clear header and footer layout so it is understandable.
* As a user, I want to click on a page to view all of the services that the company has.
* As a user, I want a page that displays all of the images.
* As a user, I want to click a button that will take me to a designated page.

## Features
Throughout the page, there is a navigation bar on the header and the footer that
takes you to the designated area. As well as this, I have put buttons on all the 
pages that will take the customer to the contact page so they will contact Sparki.

#### Existing Features
* Buttons - This allows the users to get to a page by clicking on it.
* Form - This allows the user to contact the company by filling the sections out
and pressing submit.
* Hover - This allows the user to see clearly which navigation title they might 
click on by hovering over one of the titles.
* Dropdown - This allows the user to view the navigation bar in the mobile view.
* Social Media Links - This allows the user to get the social media page by clicking
on the designated social media name.

#### Features Left to Implement
In the future as Sparki gets found more by customers and their services get use,
the company will hopefully get review from those customers. When they are a
few reviews, they will want to display the reviews on their website. I would put
those reviews on the home page as future customers will the home page covered in
good reviews which will help with advertisement for Sparki. 
Also when Sparki starts posting more on their social media platforms, they will
want that placed on their website on the home page as well.
