Katerina Elsasser’s Spraki Website

This project is for the company ‘Sparki’ which is a electrician company based 
in the south of England. The aim of the website is to promote this company to 
customers in the Berkshire/Surrey areas. The website must include what the 
electrician company can do as well as photos showing what the company can do 
(include industrial, commercial and domestic work).

UX

Strategy - 
Sparki are looking for a simple designed website that would help promote 
them to new customers and current customers that are in the area of 
Berkshire/Surrey. They want to promote to customers wanting domestic work, 
or businesses who wanted commercial and industrial work. They want to include 
photos of work that they have already done to show what they can do. 
After thinking about what they want, I started to do some research with 
companies that are in the area that would be Sparki’s competition. As well 
as this, I have looked at a popular website that specialises in promoting 
tradesmen such as Electricians. When looking at each website, made some pros 
and cons. After looking at all the pros and cons, I went back to Sparki to see 
what they like and don’t like as well as what the customer would want to see.
