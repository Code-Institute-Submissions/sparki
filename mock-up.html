                This page has all the mock ups of what would be a good layout of a website. Next to the mockups I have writen a quick summary of the pros and cons to them. Some mockups were inspired by some of the features that I liked on websites that I had researched. To view my research, <a href="https://sparki-website-katerinaelsasser21.c9users.io/research.html">click here</a>.

          <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6"><img src="../images/mock-up-1.jpg" class="mockup"></div>
                <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 text-mockup">
                    <ul>
                        <li>The image on the left was the first mockup that I designed.</li>
                        <li>Pros: I liked the navigation bar as that worked well. I could develop it more and put the logo above the navigation and then put the name in the place of where the logo is on the mockup.</li> 
                        <li>Cons: There might be too much text in the boxes, i could improve it by only having one box instead of two.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

              <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-6 text-mockup">
                  <ul>
                      <li>The image on the right was the second mockup that I drew out.</li> 
                      <li>Pros: The layout of the social media boxes are works well.</li>
                      <li>Cons: The navigation looks messy and again is a very messy layout. The grid would be a bit difficult with lots of elements floating around to create with the navigation half way down on the page.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <ul>
                      <li>The image on the left was the third mockup that I drew out.</li> 
                      <li>Pros: The bottom of the page with the image and the text taking up a row of the page. Could improve this webpage by repeating that layout on the whole section of the page.</li>
                      <li>Cons: The navigation looks very plain, could be improved by having the logo a bit bigger than the navigation menu.</li>
                  </ul>
              </div>

                  <ul>
                      <li>The image on the right was the last mockup that I drew out.</li> 
                      <li>Pros: The navigation works well. The layout of the images and the text work well but could be a bit difficult to create. To improve this, I could not merge the text over the images.</li>
                      <li>Cons: The layout of the footer will make the footer a bit too big, it could be improved by having just the navigation in the footer instead of including text/information.</li>
                  </ul>
              </div>

              <div class="col-lg-12 text">
                  In conclusion, I have decided to use elements from some of these mockups and I will involve some of the improvements that I thought of on the webpage.
